**Introduction**
<BR/>
<p>
The CFPB Complaint Database is an essential resource for understanding consumer experiences with financial products and services. It publishes complaints sent to companies only after a response is received, confirming a commercial relationship or after 15 days, with daily updates. Excluded from this database are complaints referred to other regulators, particularly those involving depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. While the database features consumer narratives shared voluntarily and with personal information removed, these narratives are not verified and should be interpreted cautiously. Itâ€™s important to note that the volume of complaints does not necessarily indicate the level of consumer harm, as larger companies may receive more complaints simply due to their size. For a more comprehensive analysis, pairing complaint data with additional public and private datasets is encouraged.

<b>Objective of the Project</b>
<p>
The objective of this project is to analyze the factors affecting the response time and quality of responses to consumer complaints across various companies. This includes identifying process inefficiencies contributing to delays, exploring correlations between consumer consent and post-response disputes, examining the influence of complaint submission methods on timely responses, and understanding the relationship between complaint types and company responses. Ultimately, the goal is to develop a model that classifies whether a response was provided in a timely manner, using various complaint-related variables, to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize the complaint resolution process.
